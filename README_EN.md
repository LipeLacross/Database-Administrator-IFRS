# Database Administrator Course

This repository contains projects and activities developed during the **Database Administrator Course**, with a focus on PostgreSQL and MySQL, applied to different business contexts such as restaurants, veterinary clinics, schools, and more.

## üî® Project Features

This project aims to build relational databases, data modeling, and SQL queries. The features implemented include:

- Creating tables and relationships for different types of businesses.
- Populating tables with sample data for operations simulation.
- Implementing Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used for data storage.
- **MySQL**: Relational database used for alternative projects.
- **SQL**: Language for database creation and query execution.
- **ER Diagrams**: Visual database modeling representing entities and their relationships.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project

To open and run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install PostgreSQL or MySQL**:
    - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) must be installed on your system.
    - You can check if it's already installed by running:

      ```bash
      psql --version  # For PostgreSQL
      mysql --version  # For MySQL
      ```

    - If it's not installed, download and install the database software.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Copy the repository URL and run the following command in your terminal:

      ```bash
      git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
      ```

3. **Import SQL Scripts**:
    - After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder and run the SQL scripts in the respective databases to create tables and populate them with data.

      For PostgreSQL:

      ```bash
      psql -U your_user -d database_name -f path/to/script.sql
      ```

      For MySQL:

      ```bash
      mysql -u your_user -p database_name < path/to/script.sql
      ```

## üåê Deploy

The deploy of databases can be done using services like **Heroku**, **AWS RDS**, or **Google Cloud SQL**. Below are the basic steps to deploy on a cloud service:

1. **Create the Database on the Deploy Platform**:
    - Choose a managed database service, such as AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL.
    - Follow the instructions to create a database on the chosen platform.

2. **Import Data**:
    - After creating the database on the cloud service, import the SQL scripts using the terminal or the SQL management tool provided by the platform.

3. **Configure Access**:
    - Set up remote access permissions and database users as needed for your production environment.
